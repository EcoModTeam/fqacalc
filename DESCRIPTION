Description: A collection of functions for calculating Floristic Quality 
    Assessment (FQA) metrics using regional FQA databases that have been reviewed 
    and certified as ecological planning models by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
    (USACE). These databases are stored in a sister R package, `fqadata`. 
    Both packages were developed for the USACE by the U.S. Army Engineer Research 
    and Development Centerâ€™s Environmental Laboratory.
