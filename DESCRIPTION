Description: A collection of functions for calculating Floristic Quality 
    Assessment (FQA) metrics using regional FQA databases that have been approved
    or approved with reservations as ecological planning models by the U.S. Army 
    Corps of Engineers (USACE). These databases are stored in a sister R package, 
    'fqadata'. Both packages were developed for the USACE by the U.S. Army Engineer 
    Research and Development Centerâ€™s Environmental Laboratory.
